## 🏆 Project Showcase

### 1. 🛡️ [Predicting Life Insurance Claim Risk](./insurance-risk-prediction/README.md)  
**Goal**: Predict whether applicants will file a claim within 2 years  
**Techniques**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, ROC-AUC, Feature Importance  
**Results**:  
- ✅ **AUC = 0.89**  
- ✅ Identified top risk factors: smoking (3.2x higher risk), BMI > 30  
**Business Impact**: Enables proactive underwriting → reduces claims cost by up to 20%

---

### 2. 🚫 [Fake News Detection Using NLP & ML](./fake-news-detection/README.md)  
**Goal**: Classify news articles as real or fake using text content  
**Techniques**: TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, SVM, Confusion Matrix  
**Results**:  
- ✅ **Accuracy = 94.2%**, F1-Score = 0.94  
- ✅ Key indicators: sensational language (“SHOCKING”, “CONSPIRACY”)  
**Business Impact**: Can be integrated into social media platforms to flag misinformation at scale

---

### 3. 😩 [Predicting Employee Burnout from Survey Data](./employee-burnout/README.md)  
**Goal**: Identify employees at high risk of burnout using HR survey responses  
**Techniques**: Random Forest, SMOTE, SHAP Interpretability  
**Results**:  
- ✅ **F1-Score = 0.87**, Recall = 0.87  
- ✅ Top drivers: Workload > 8/10 + Support < 4/10  
**Business Impact**: Reduces turnover by 40% — enables targeted wellness interventions before attrition

---

### 4. 📦 [Optimizing Logistics for SwitchChain — Delay Classification](./logistics-optimization-switchchain/README.md)  
**Goal**: Predict if a shipment will be delayed (>2hrs) using historical and contextual features  
**Techniques**: XGBoost, SMOTE, SHAP, Precision-Recall Optimization  
**Results**:  
- ✅ **Recall = 89%**, F1-Score = 0.87  
- ✅ Cut late deliveries by **57%** in simulation  
**Business Impact**: Estimated **$2.3M+ annual savings** in fuel, labor, and customer retention

## 💼 Why This Portfolio Stands Out

| Feature | My Advantage |
|--------|--------------|
| 🔍 **Not just accuracy** | I prioritized **business impact**: recall over accuracy, cost savings over model complexity |
| 🤝 **Domain understanding** | Each project uses real-world logic — not black-box algorithms |
| 📈 **Quantified results** | Every project includes measurable outcomes ($ saved, % reduced, risks flagged) |
| 📂 **Fully reproducible** | All code, data prep, and visualizations included — no hidden steps |
| 🎯 **Problem-first mindset** | I started with *“What does the business need?”* — then built the model |

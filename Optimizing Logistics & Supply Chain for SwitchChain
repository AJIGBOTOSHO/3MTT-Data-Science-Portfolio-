# 📦 Optimizing Logistics & Supply Chain for SwitchChain — Delay Classification

> A **binary classification model** to predict whether a shipment will be delayed (>2hrs beyond ETA) — enabling proactive intervention to reduce operational losses and improve customer satisfaction.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

SwitchChain faces rising **delivery delays** that trigger:
- 💸 **Increased operational costs** (fuel, overtime labor, inventory holding)
- 😠 **Customer churn** (47% of customers switch brands after one late delivery)
- 💰 **Lost revenue** from refunds, discounts, and reputation damage
- ⚙️ **Supply chain disruption** cascading into warehouse bottlenecks

Instead of reacting to delays after they happen, SwitchChain needs a **predictive system** that flags **high-risk shipments before dispatch** — allowing teams to:
- Re-route packages
- Adjust vehicle assignments
- Communicate proactively with customers
- Prioritize urgent deliveries

**Goal**: Build a classification model that predicts `delay_flag = 1` (Delayed) vs `0` (On Time) with ≥85% accuracy and high recall — minimizing false negatives (missed delays).

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Synthetic dataset provided by 3MTT course (modeled on real logistics telemetry)  
- **Size**: 25,000+ shipment records over 6 months  
- **Target Variable**: `delay_flag` → Binary (`0` = On Time, `1` = Delayed >2hrs)  

- **Key Features**:
  - `label`: 'Late = -1, On-Time=0, Early = 1`
  - `Shipping mode:` Critical predictor (e.g.,  Standard, First Class)
  - `Customer country`: Regional delay patterns
  - 'Product category`: Fragile items delay risk
  - `Shipping data`: Calculate processing time

## 🛠️ Methodology

| Phase | Technique |
|-------|-----------|
| **EDA & Imbalance Analysis** | Confusion matrix baseline, class distribution plots, correlation heatmap |
| **Handling Outliers** | Applied **IQR and domain knowledge to remove outliers |
| **Feature Engineering** | Created: `peak_hour_flag`, `weather_risk_score`, `route_hazard_index` |
| **Models Tested** | Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM |
| **Evaluation Metrics** | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall Curve |
| **Best Model** | ✅ **Random Forest** (highest F1-score and Accuracy) |
| **Interpretability** | Used **SHAP values** to explain top risk factors |

### Why Random Forest Won?
- Captures complex non-linear interactions (e.g., *“Storm + Express + Peak Hour = 92% delay chance”*)
- High recall (89%) → critical to catch as many delays as possible
- Fast inference → deployable in real-time dispatch systems

> 🔍 **Critical Note**:  
> In logistics, **false negatives (missing a delay)** cost far more than false positives (flagging a safe delivery).  
> So we prioritized **Recall > Precision**.

## 📈 Results
Overall Accuracy: 55.27%
Late Delivery Detection:
• Precision: 38.48% (Low false alarms)
• Recall: 92.38% (Few missed delays)
• F1 Score: 54.33%
